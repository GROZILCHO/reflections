Q1: When would you like to create remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I want to share my project for colaboration with other developers and when I want to back up and easy access to my project.

Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Manually changes allowed me to know if unexpected changes happened to my project.
